# Information Security Managemenet Notes

- The deadly sins fall into the four broad categories i.e. **Web application sins**, **Implementation sins**, **Cryptographic sins**, and **networking sins**.
- **Leadership** involves inspiring, motivating, and guiding individuals or group of people in achieving a common goal whereas **management** involves planning, organizing and controlling the available resources to achieve a particular goal.
- Organizing is the structuring of resources to maximize their efficiency and ease of use.
- Traditional Management Theory uses `DOSPC`
- Popular Management Theory uses `PCLO`
- **Strategic Planning** **---** High Level, for long term, five or more years
- **Tactical Planning** **---** Production Planning, for intermediate duration, one to five years
- **Operational Planning** **---** Day to Day objectives, short duration.
- Management is managing resources and structuring the departments and associative staff.
- In general, ***controlling*** ensures the **validity** of the organization's plan.
- In simple terms, governance refers to the processes, structures, and principles that guide decision-making and ensure **accountability** in organizations or systems. It involves establishing **rules, policies, and procedures** to regulate behavior, manage risks, and achieve objectives effectively and ethically.
- Problem Solving Steps:
	1. Recognize the problem.
	2. Gather Facts and Make Assumptions
	3. Develop Possible Solutions
	4. Analyze and compare the possible solutions
	5. Select, Implement, and Evaluate
- Several type of information security plans exit to support non-normal operations these plans include **incident response planning, business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning, policy planning, and personnel planning.**
- **Policy:** Guidelines that dictate certain behavior within the organization.
- **Why Do I have to Learn Management?**
	1. It equips individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to protect valuable information assets from cyber threats and risks such as data breaches, hacking, and malware attacks.
	2. Understanding infosec management principles is essential for ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
	3. Higher risks of InfoSec failure.
* **Normative Ethics:** The study of what makes actions right or wrong. *How should people act?*
* **Meta Ethics:** The study of meaning of ethical judgment.
* **Descriptive Ethics:** The study of choice made by an individual. *What do others think is right?*
* **Applied Ethics:** An approach that applies moral codes to actions. *How we might have used ethics in practice?*
* **Deontological Ethics:** The study of rightness and wrongness of the intensions. This approach seeks to define a person's ethical duty.
* Deterrence is the best method for preventing an illegal or unethical activity. Or the action of preventing an unwanted action by threatening and punishment if the act takes place. 
* Ignorance of law is no excuse but ignorance of polices is.
* Criminal or unethical intent refers to the state of mins of the individual while committing something.
* **Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)** --- regulates the interception of wire, electronic, and oral communications.
* **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** --- It attempts to protect the confidentiality and security of health care data by establishing and enforcing standards and by standardizing electronic data interchange.
* **American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)** --- provides a response to the economic crisis in the United States.
* **Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH)** --- was designed to promote the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) by healthcare providers and to ensure that such records are secure and protected from unauthorized access or disclosure.
* **Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB)** --- This act requires all financial institutions to disclose their privacy policies, describing how they share nonpublic personal information.
* **Export and Espionage Laws** --- These laws attempt to stem the theft of information by establishing strong penalties for related crimes.
* **U . S . Copyright Law** --- protection to intellectual property, which includes words published in electronic formats.
* **Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)** --- All federal agencies are required under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to disclose records requested in writing by any person.
* **Breach Laws** --- A breach law specifies a requirement for organizations to notify affected parties when they have experienced a specified type of loss of information. This often includes specific forms of PII from various stakeholders.
* **Digital Millennium Copyright Act** --- The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is the U.S based international effort to reduce the impact of copyright, trademark, and privacy infringement, especially via the removal of technological copyright protection measures.
* **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCIDSS)** --- is a set of industry standards that are mandated for any organization that handles credit, debit, and specialty payment cards.
* **Laws:** Laws are rules and regulations established and enforced by a governing authority, such as a government. They are legally binding and carry the force of the law. Violating laws can result in penalties, fines, or legal consequences, enforced by the judicial system.
* **Standards** are guidelines set by groups or organizations to help achieve certain goals, but they are not legally required.
* Many investigations begin with an allegation or an indication of an incident.
* Digital Forensics Methodology
	1. Identify Relative Items for evidentiary value.
	2. Seize the evidentiary value collected.
	3. Takes steps to ensure that the collected evidences are not changed.
	4. Report the finding to the proper authority.
- Digital Forensics Process
	1. Identify Relevant Items
	2. Acquire the Evidence
	3. Other potential evidences
	4. EM Handling
	5. Authenticate the recovered evidence (**by cryptographic hash tools**)
	6. Analyze the data using the method of indexing (**In digital forensics, indexing refers to the process of creating a searchable database or catalog of digital evidence collected from various sources, such as computers, mobile devices, and storage media. This database typically includes metadata and information about the files, folders, and other digital artifacts found during the forensic investigation**)
	7. Report the findings 
- **Administrative** also known as the soft controls as they are more management oriented. Risk management, documentation, and training.
- **Technical Controls** also known as the logical controls are software or hardware based controls like `firewall` or `IDS/IPS`.
- **Physical Controls** are put in place to safeguard the physical premises of an organization.
- Access Controls.
	1. Compensating Control
	2. Control Effectiveness
	3. Control Efficiency
	4. Control Scope
	5. Control Complexity
	6. Control Access
	7. Control Privilege
- Information risk management (IRM) is the process of identifying and assessing risk, reducing it to an acceptable level, and implementing the right mechanisms to maintain that level.
- Risk analysis has four main goals
	1. Identify assets and their value to the organization
	2. Identify vulnerabilities and threats
	3. Quantify the probability and business impact of these potential threats.
	4. Provide an economic balance between the impact of the threat and the cost of the countermeasure.
- The IRM policy should be a subset of the organization’s overall risk management policy and should be mapped to the organizational security policies.
- The overall goal of the team is to ensure the company is protected in the most cost-effective manner.
- An asset can have both quantitative and qualitative measurements assigned to it, but these measurements need to be derived first.
- Why to determine Asset Value?
	1. To perform effective cost/benefit analysis
	2. To select specific countermeasures and safeguards
	3. To determine the level of insurance coverage to purchase
	4. To understand what exactly is at risk
	5. To comply with legal and regulatory requirements
- ***Quantitative:*** A quantitative risk analysis is used to assign monetary and numeric values to all elements of the risk analysis process. Each element within the analysis **(asset value, threat frequency, severity of vulnerability, impact damage, safeguard costs, safeguard effectiveness, uncertainty, and probability items)** is quantified and entered into equations to determine total and residual risks. It is more of a scientific or mathematical approach to risk analysis compared to qualitative
- ***Qualitative:*** A qualitative risk analysis uses a **“softer”** approach to the data elements of a risk analysis. It does not quantify that data, which means that it does not assign numeric values to the data so that they can be used in equations. A **qualitative risk analysis** would not present these findings in monetary values, but would assign ratings to the risks, as in ***Red, Yellow, and Green***
- A quantitative analysis uses risk calculations that attempt to predict the level of monetary losses and the probability for each type of threat.
- Qualitative analysis does not use calculations. Instead, it is more opinion and scenario-based and uses a rating system to relay the risk criticality levels.
- The **exposure factor (EF)** represents the percentage of loss a realized threat could have on a certain asset.
- Qualitative techniques to gather data are ***brainstorming, focus groups, surveys, questionnaires, checklists, one-on-one meetings, and interviews***.
- The exposure possibility and loss possibility can be ranked as ***high, medium, or low*** on a scale of `1` to `5` or `1` to `10`
- Cons of ***Quantitative assessment.***
	1. Quantitative data focuses on **"what"** and **"how much"** through numbers, but it can miss the **"why"** and the deeper meaning behind the results.
	2. Quantitative methods only assess things that can be easily measured and converted into numbers.
	3. Poorly designed surveys or experiments can lead to biased data.
- Cons of ***Qualitative assessment***
	1. Qualitative data is based on interpretation and analysis of observations and interviews. This can lead to subjective bias on the part of the researcher.
	2. Qualitative methods typically involve in-depth exploration with a small group of participants. This makes it difficult to generalize the findings to a larger population.
	3. Qualitative research can be very time-consuming.
- **Total Risk** is the risk a company faces where as the **residual risk** is the risk remaining after implementing all the mitigations and countermeasures. 
- Risk Avoidance --- ***alternative***
---
* The entire set of activities, resources, personnel, and technological used by the organization to manage risk to its information assets is called information security plan.
* Security in Large Organizations can be divided into four major parts.
	* Non technological aspects like Legal Aspects and Training. (out side IT area)
	* Functions performed outside the information security area like network security management and system security management.
	* Technical functions performed within info sec boundary like Risk Assessment, System testing, etc.
	* Non technical functions within info sec boundary like policy, compliance, and risk management.
* In a small organization, InfoSec often becomes the responsibility of a jack-of-all-trades, a single security administrator with perhaps one or two assistants for managing the technical components.
* The InfoSec needs of an organization are unique to its culture, size, and budget.
* Determining the level at which the InfoSec program operates depends on the organization's strategic plan, and in particular on the plan's vision and mission statements.
* **CISO:** Though not usually an *executive-level* position, the chief information security officer (**CISO**) is usually considered the top InfoSec officer in the organization. He or she frequently reports to the chief information officer (**CIO**), unless the organization employs a chief security officer (**CSO**) who oversees both physical and InfoSec areas. Although **CISOs** are business managers first and technologists second, they must be conversant in all areas of InfoSec, including technology, planning, and policy.
* **SETA Programs** -- Security Education, Training, and Awareness Programs
* **Training Delivery Methods.**
  1.  One-to-One
  2. Formal Classes
  3. Computer Based Training
  4. Distance Learning/Web Seminars
  5. User support groups
  6. On the job training
  7. Self Study
* **Implementing Training**
	▪ *Step 1 -* Identify program scope, goals, and objectives
	▪ *Step 2 -* Identify training staff
	▪ *Step 3 -* Identify target audiences
	▪ *Step 4 -* Motivate management and employees
	▪ *Step 5 -* Administer the program
	▪ *Step 6 -* Maintain the program
	▪ *Step 7 -* Evaluate the program
* ***How can InfoSec be both a process and a project?*** InfoSec is, in fact, a continuous series or chain of projects that comprise a process.
* Information security policy is a written document with instructions from the management that informs employees and others in the workplace about paper behavior regarding the use of information and information assets.
* Policy is a managerial document that guides the employees behavior in the organization.
* Bull's eye model

```
|| Policy || Networks || Systems || Applications ||
```

* Policy being the outer most and Applications being the inner most layer.
* Nonmandatory recommendations the employees may use as a reference to comply with a privacy policy. If the policy says ***use strong passwords*** than the guideline would say that ***don't use pet or family names as passwords***.
* Procedures are the step-by-step instructions that help employees in complying with the policies. If the policy says ***use strong passwords*** then the procedure would be like ***in order to change your password go to windows > setting > change password***.
* Three major types of policies
	1. Enterprise information security policy `(EISP)`
	2. Issue-specific security policy `(ISSP)`
	3. System-specific security policy `(SysSP)`
---
* ***Enterprise information security policy `(EISP)`***: 
	The high-level information security policy that sets the strategic tone, direction, and scope of the an organization's security efforts.
	* An overview of the corporate philosophy on security
	* Information on the structure of the InfoSec organization and individuals who fulfill the InfoSec role
	* Fully articulated responsibilities for security that are shared by all members of the organization (employees, contractors, consultants, partners, and visitors)
	* Fully articulated responsibilities for security that are unique to each role within the organization
* Champion is a high level executive, such as CIO or VIP-IT, who provides policy support and influence for a specific project.
* **SecSDLC**
	1. *Investigation*: The investigation phase of the SecSDLC begins with a directive from upper management specifying the process, outcomes, and goals of the project as well as its budget and other constraints. Frequently, this phase begins with the affirmation or creation of security policies on which the security program of the organization is or will be founded. Teams of managers, employees, and consultants are assembled to investigate problems, define their scope, specify goals and objectives.
	2. *Analysis*: In the analysis phase, the team studies the documents from the investigation phase. The development team that was assembled during the investigation phase conducts a preliminary analysis of existing security policies or programs along with documented current threats and associated controls. This phase also includes an analysis of relevant legal issues that could affect the design of the security solution.
	3. *Design:* In the logical design phase, team members create and develop the blueprint for security, and they examine and implement key policies that influence later decisions. At this stage, critical contingency plans for incident response are developed. Next, a feasibility analysis determines whether the project should continue in-house or should be outsourced.
	4. *Implementation:* The SecSDLC implementation phase is similar to the corresponding phase of the traditional SDLC. Security solutions are acquired (made or bought), tested, implemented, and retested.
	5. Maintenance: The maintenance and change phase, though last, is perhaps the most important, given the flexibility and persistence of many of the threats facing the modern organization. Today's InfoSec systems need constant monitoring, testing, modifying, updating, and repairing.
* ***Issue-specific security policy `(ISSP)`***
	An organization policy that provides detailed, targeted guidance to instruct all members of the organization in the use of a resource, such as one of its processes or technologies.
	* It articulates the organization's expectations about how its technology-based resources should be used.
	* It documents how the technology-based resource is controlled and identifies the processes and authorities that provide this control.
	* It indemnifies the organization against liability for an employee's inappropriate or illegal use of the resource.
	Every organization's ISSP has three characteristics:
	- It addresses specific technology-based resources.
	- It requires frequent updates.
	- It contains a statement explaining the organization's position on a particular issue.
	It should have the following aspects
	-  Statement of Purpose
	- Authorized Uses
	- Prohibited Uses
	- Systems Management
	- Violations of Policy
	- Policy Review and Modification
	- Implementing the ISSP
		- Create a number of ISSP documents, each tailored to a specific issue.
		- Create a single comprehensive ISSP document that covers all issues.
		- Create a modular ISSP document that unifies policy creation and administration while maintaining each specific issue's requirements.
* ***System-specific security policy `(SysSP)`***

---
* `CSIRT` stands for ***Computer Security Incident Response Team***
* A CSIRT is a team of IT security experts whose main business is to respond to computer security incidents. It provides the necessary services to handle them and support their constituents to recover from breaches.
* In order to mitigate risks and minimize the number of required responses, most CSIRTs also provide preventative and educational services for their constituency.

| Reactive CSIRT                                                               | Proactive CSIRT                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
